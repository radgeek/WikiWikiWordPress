== Description ==
WikiWikiWordPress is a simple, pleasant to use fork of the WordPress Wiki Plugin
originally created by the developers at [Instinct][]. I (that's me, Charles
Johnson) forked the project because it hadn't been updated since the release
of WordPress 3.2, and I needed some quick fixes -- as well as some longer term
improvements -- in order to use this plugin as the Wiki engine for the
[FeedWordPress][] project website.
